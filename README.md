# WTM-Chatbot

## Project Description

Chatbots are computer programs that mimic conversation with people through the use of artificial intelligence. In a nutshell, when someone types in a message, the bot responds with the right reply. The project is to build a messenger bot for a Facebook page which responds on my behalf. The project will include a tinge of NLP processing using Google’s DialogFlow platform.

## Outcomes:

Develop a messenger chatbot powered by DialogFlow for NLP. A basic understanding of bot frameworks which’ll help build bots on any platform (eg. telegram) in future.
